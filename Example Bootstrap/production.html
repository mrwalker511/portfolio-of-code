                	172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,[8] to the male mandrill, almost

                	while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the various species but may contain any of the 
                	following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).

                <p><b>Web development</b> is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or 
                	an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of plain 
                	text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. 
                	A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include web design, web content 
                	development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, web server and network security configuration, 
                	and e-commerce development. Among web professionals, "web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects 
                	of building web sites: writing markup and coding.<br/><br/>

					For larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (web developers). 
					Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting webmaster, or secondary assignment to related 
					job positions such as a graphic designer and/or information systems technician. Web development may be a collaborative 
					effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.Web design encompasses many different skills 
					and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites.<br/><br/>
