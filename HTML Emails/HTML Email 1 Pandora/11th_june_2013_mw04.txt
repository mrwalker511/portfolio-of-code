Gently Do THIS - and You’ll Get...

You’re kissing. You want it to happen…

You’re so ready you can imagine tasting her as she... 

How quickly can you take it there (without turning her off so she runs away)?

Now You… 

A. Awkwardly grope her boob like you’re desperate, hoping you don’t get slapped.

B. Keep kissing her, hoping she won’t get bored, and stop you because she has ‘better things to do’.	

C. Turn her on, using what I’ve revealed below, until she willingly removes first her top then her...

Wait! If you’re thinking, “That’s easier said than done” then I’ve got FOUR MUST-TOUCH ZONES you’ll love implementing right away (and she’ll love it too):

I like to call this technique, “Hunting for hot spots”.

Normally, it might take you years to find them—that’s years of fun, so no complaints here. 

Today you’re in luck because we’re going to focus on the Top 4 (most likely) places she’s hoping you’ll touch (in the most logical order possible) just in case you want to get your fantasies fulfilled faster:

First Do This:

#1 – Gently Kiss Her Inner Elbow—don’t be surprised at how quickly she begins moaning.

Her skin, super sensitive. A kiss her is guaranteed to drive her wild.

Hot Access Acceleration Tip: Gently run her finger over this spot (if by accident) to get her to moan before you kiss her there…


Next Do This:

#2 – Gently Stroke Behind Her Knee—on your way up. 

No one thinks to touch her here, so you’re leaving a lasting memory. 

Hot Access Acceleration Tip: Begin by giving her a calf massage and slowly work your way up to the back of her thighs, giving it extra attention along the way.

Then Do This:

#3 - Her Wrists Trigger the “Danger Effect” That Increases Blood Flow EVERYWHERE


Ready to see her temperate rise to the ‘peak point’? Give her goosebumps (the good kind)?

You can thank evolution for this one: Since so many blood vessels flow under the skin here, this area is super sensitive. (We need to know if it's in danger.).

This means the gentlest brush of your fingertips can instantly cause goosebumps.

Hot Access Acceleration Tip: Use your mouth to kiss or bite for an added sense of danger and rush of blood to every region of her body. 

Now Seal the Deal When You Do THIS:

#4 – The “Hard to Get Access to Classic”. Her Neck…

But it’s not what you seem. Yes, kiss away. But we’ve got a way to accelerate our access to other touchable body parts. 

Ready to turn up the heat?

Hot Access Acceleration Tip: Bite her. Don’t laugh. Do it gently, a nip here, and pause for longer each time. Remember to begin between her neck and shoulder. Add just a little pressure.

When you hear her moan in pleasure, add a little more pressure. Pay close attention to her reaction, because if she likes to be bitten (especially hard) then she’ll love being tied up—and other kinky things. 

Now you know how to get any woman to take off her shirt—or anything else you’d like—and make the first move. 

Simple, isn’t it? 

You know what works even faster? Which words will have her gushing inside with lust for you…

The perfectly planned conversation. Yes, there are 4 (or more) sensitive types of conversation you can tap into right now, if you want to see her become addicted to you. 

Like these four spots, you’re not guessing. You’re simply leveraging the knowledge scientists have discovered that allows you to quickly tap into her hardwired genetic code.
