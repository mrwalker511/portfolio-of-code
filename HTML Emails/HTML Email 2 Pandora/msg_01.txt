Exclusive Pandora's Box Members Only Email: Welcome To Pandora's Box 	

Hello %%First Name%%,

Congratulations are in order. You’ve now been with the Pandora’s Box program for nearly 8 months and you are reaching your 
first level of mastery.

You’ve opened the door to an elite world, and today I’m going to talk to you about what comes next– how you can overcome 
those few remaining gaps in your game, and apply the skills and knowledge you’ve acquired to become a superstar.

By now, you have have watched and re-watched all the materials so many times that you know women better than 99.5% of all 
men on the planet. (And, truthfully, you probably know why women behave the way they do even better than they do.)

Now phrases like NJI, TDI, and NDR are not arcane gibberish but the Rosetta Stone for attracting the hottest women you can 
imagine. Within 30-seconds of meeting a girl you now know her exact personality type and what it’s going to take to seduce her. It isn’t magic, 
trickery, or some corny routine. It’s a blueprint for understanding what makes her tick, what turns her on, and how to make her think you 
are the guy she’s been waiting to meet her whole life.

But what’s the next step on this journey? How do you go from ‘good’ to legendary?

If you’re like most of my students you are feeling like a mythic hero right now. You are getting more attention from women 
than you ever have, your sex life has taken a dramatic leap forward, and the confidence you’ve gained through the Pandora’s Box training is 
paying off in unexpected ways at work and in non-sexual social situations.

Can it get any better than this? Believe it or not… it can.

You’ve just opened the first door, and by continuing your training I will show you how to unlock a much richer level of success 
than you can presently imagine. 

Think of where you are now as achieving your 1st degree black belt in attracting and seducing women – you’ve learned a 
tremendous amount, and your eyes have been opened to an entire world of new possibilities, but you realize this is only the beginning – the best is 
still yet to come.

By continuing your training you will work through your few remaining “trouble spots” and soon no woman will be beyond your 
ability to seduce her. You will truly achieve what few men in history ever get to experience.

In order to help guide you on this next leg of your journey I have developed a series of Master Seminars to help you take the 
next major step forward.

They will be presented as audio courses that you will find in the Pandora’s Box dashboard. They have been specifically created 
for guys in your situation who have reached their first level of mastery. This content is completely FREE and part of your continued 
Pandora’s Box subscription.

In a few days I will be ready to launch the first installment, and I will notify you via email when it is ready. You will want to be 
sure to check it out. It features Master Matt, one of our master coaches. Matt has worked one-on-one with thousands of guys all over the world and 
helped them work through the remaining gaps in their technique and provide the fine tuning that elevates guys to entirely new levels of 
success. 

In this five-part interview, Matt will share an in-depth vision of what’s possible and how to get started on the next leg of your 
journey. You won’t want to miss it.

Happy hunting.

Vin.
